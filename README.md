## ðŸª„ What does DDSparklez do?
Got a bunch of *.dds* files sitting around, taunting you with their lack of *.png*-ness? This scriptâ€™s got you covered. It scans your folder for every *.dds* file it can find, converts them all to .png like itâ€™s no big deal, and saves the day. Batch processing? *Obviously.* Hassle-free? *Absolutely.* Just run it and let it do its thing. No more manual conversions, because fuck you that's why.

### Requirements
- This project uses uses ImageMagick, a command-line tool for image manipulation.
## Installation

Windows:
    Download and install from ImageMagick's official site.

Verify the installation:
Run the following command to ensure ImageMagick is properly installed:

    magick -version

Make sure the magick command is in your system's PATH.

### How to Use
- **Open** the `.zip` and put the file somewhere smart
- **Open** the file
- **Move** every .DDS you want to convert into the `Input` folder *OR* just locate the folder that has all the .dds files you want to convert. The `Input`/`Output` folders were for convenience
- **Wait for the conversions**
- **If successful** you should get a pop-up telling you as such

You're all set.

> [!TIP]  
> It was designed in mind so I can easily conver Telltale Games files to .png files, so that's probably why there's a couple tester files in there.
